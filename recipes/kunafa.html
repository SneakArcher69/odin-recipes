  <p>
    Kunafa is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with spun pastry
    called kataifi, soaked in a sweet, sugar-based syrup called attar, and
    typically layered with cheese, or with other ingredients such as clotted
    cream, pistachio or nuts, depending on the region. It is popular in the
    Middle East.

      large bowl. Add the remaining butter and mix with kunafa shreds to coat
      evenly. Transfer half of the dough to the tray and press firmly ,lining
      sides of the tray so it will hold the cream filling and prevent it from
      burning.
